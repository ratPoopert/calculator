# calculator

A semi-realistic simulation of a very popular elementary calculator.

This calculator is written according to the Calculator project specifications outlined in The Odin Project's Foundations course. Click [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator) to see the original specifications.

Aside from the background image, all visuals are pure CSS.

In retrospect, I quickly went down the rabbit hole on this one. My commit history as of this writing is sparse. With that said, I'm very proud of the result and learned a ton on this project.

Early on in the project I decided to simulate the TI-108, which gave me a target to shoot for. As my knowledge of CSS grows in the future, I'd like to add more life-like effects:

* Make the display fade out when the cursor is hovered over the solar panel.
* Make the display simulate the holographic distortion you get when pushing your finger on an LCD display.
* Figure out what the memory buttons actually do (never figured that out in school) and implement that logic.
* Implement the actual percentage logic for the percent button.

This project was tested in Firefox, so if you notice any issues when viewing in another browser, please let me know.
